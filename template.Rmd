```{r}

I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3
 This is going to make a plot! First I generate a dataframe, then use `ggplot` to make a scatterplot. 
 
 Here's a **code chunk** that samples from
```{r chunk_scatterplot, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
plot_df = 
  tibble(
  x = rnorm(n=1000),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)
